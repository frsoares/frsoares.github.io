My research interests are mainly software engineering and programming languages (especially functional PLs). I hold a B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Polytechnic School of Pernambuco](http://poli.upe.br), part of the State University of Pernambuco (UPE), where I did research on fault-tolerance for grid computing, and a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the my current university, on refactoring Concurrent Haskell programs and Software Transactional Memory. In all instances I have worked under Prof. Fernando Castor (@fernandocastor), and have been co-advised on my M.Sc. by Prof. Andr√© Santos.\r\n\r\nI currently divide my time between my graduate research and teaching iOS development. Previously I have worked as a Systems Engineer at [usto.re](ustore.com.br), and as a Software Engineer developing mobile apps at [Fingertips](http://ftips.com.br).\r\n\r\n",
